This repository contains code samples and techniques referenced in my Medium blog post, ["Minimal APIs in .NET Core"](https://medium.com/@jepozdemir/minimal-apis-in-net-core-bb6ba69c4dfe). This post and repository focus on leveraging Minimal APIs in .NET Core to build lightweight and efficient web applications.

## Overview
Minimal APIs were introduced in .NET 6 as a simpler way to build web APIs with reduced boilerplate code. This blog post explores the key features of Minimal APIs, demonstrates how to implement them, and highlights their advantages and limitations.

### Topics Covered

- **What Are Minimal APIs?**  
  An introduction to Minimal APIs, their purpose, and how they differ from traditional controllers in ASP.NET Core.

- **Setting Up a Minimal API Project**  
  Step-by-step instructions to create a new .NET Core project and configure Minimal APIs.

- **Key Features**  
  Overview of essential Minimal API capabilities, including:
  - Defining endpoints using `MapGet`, `MapPost`, etc.
  - Dependency injection
  - Route parameters and query string handling
  - Model binding and validation

- **Advantages of Minimal APIs**  
  Why you might choose Minimal APIs, such as:
  - Reduced boilerplate code
  - Simplicity for small or focused applications
  - Improved startup performance

- **Limitations of Minimal APIs**  
  Scenarios where Minimal APIs might not be the best choice, including:
  - Complex applications requiring advanced features
  - Preference for MVC architectural patterns
